# Clinical Trial Participant Forecasting Report
This project focuses on forecasting the potential number of qualified participants for a clinical trial based on historical data from past studies in the U.S. and Europe. Using data analytics techniques, I analyzed trial eligibility criteria, historical enrollment rates, and regional trends to estimate potential participant pools.
