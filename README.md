# Clinical Trial Participant Forecasting & Cost Analysis
 ðŸ‘€ This project focuses on forecasting the potential number of qualified participants for a clinical trial based on historical data from past studies in the U.S. and Europe. Leveraging data analytics, I analyzed trial eligibility criteria, historical enrollment rates, and regional prevalence data to estimate participant pools while also conducting a detailed cost analysis for trial feasibility.

# Key Features:

ðŸŒŸ Data Analysis & Forecasting: Evaluated past clinical trials to predict participant qualification rates.

ðŸŒŸ Prevalence Data Visualizations: Developed graphs comparing U.S. and European prevalence rates.

ðŸŒŸ Enrollment Timeline Modeling: Created detailed projections of enrollment trends, including even and ramped-up recruitment scenarios displayed in both tables and graphs.

ðŸŒŸ Funnel Chart Analysis: Illustrated the progression of participants through qualification stages.

ðŸŒŸ Costing (RFP) Table: Conducted a comprehensive cost analysis, breaking down expenses associated with trial execution.

ðŸŒŸ This project demonstrates my ability to analyze clinical trial data, forecast participant eligibility, create dynamic visualizations, and perform financial feasibility assessments 

ðŸŒŸ for trial planning.
